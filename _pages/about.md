In February 2024, I started as a **postdoctoral researcher at IRIT in the MAMBO team**. I work with [Pierre Weiss](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~weiss/) as part of the [MicroBlind ANR project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-CE48-0008).

I study **inverse problems in optical microscopy**, currently carrying two main projects:

1. **Deep learning for blind deblurring** of fluorescence microscopy images.
2. **Neural networks for instance segmentation** of individuals cells in images biological sample with _partial annotations_.

Over the course of my career in Astrophysics (PhD 2018), I have developped a strong interest in **inverse problem solving _via_ a Bayesian approach** while studying galaxy evolution using large photometric surveys.  
This led me to take a position in the MAMBO team to further explore inverse problem solving in high dimensions in a different context.

**I still work part-time on my research in Astrophysics**. There, I mainly study the evolution of star-formation in galaxies through cosmic time.
I am interested in understanding the role played by the environment surrounding galaxies on large scales on their history and their fate.
I am still actively invested in several international collaborations (Euclid, XCLASS).
