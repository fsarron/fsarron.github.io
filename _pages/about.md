In February 2024, I started as a **postdoctoral researcher at IRIT in the MAMBO team**.  
I work with [Pierre Weiss](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~weiss/) as part of the [MicroBlind ANR project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-CE48-0008).

I study **Inverse Problems in optical microscopy**, currently carrying two main projects: 
1. I use **deep learning for blind deblurring** of fluorescence microscopy images.
2. I use **neural networks for instance segmentation** of individuals cells in images biological sample with partial annotations.


Over the course of my career in Astrophysics (PhD 2018), while studying galaxy evolution using large photometric surveys, I have developped a strong interest in **inverse problem solving _via_ a Bayesian approach**.  
This led me to take the position in the MAMBO team to further explore inverse problem solving in high dimensions in a different context.

**I still work part-time on my research in Astrophysics**. There, I mainly study the evolution of star-formation in galaxies through cosmic time. 
I am interested in understanding the role played by the environment surrounding galaxies on large scale on their history and their fate. 
I am still actively invested in several international collaborations (Euclid, XCLASS).
