        abstract= {"Galaxy morphologies and shape orientations are expected to correlate with their 
        large-scale environment, since they grow by accreting matter from the cosmic web and are 
        subject to interactions with other galaxies. Cosmic filaments are extracted in projection 
        from the Euclid Quick Data Release 1 (covering 63.1 deg2) at 0.5<z<0.9 in tomographic slices
         of 170 comoving h−1Mpc using photometric redshifts. Galaxy morphologies are accurately 
         retrieved thanks to the excellent resolution of VIS data. The distribution of massive 
         galaxies (M∗>10^10M⊙) in the projected cosmic web is analysed as a function of morphology 
         measured from VIS data. Specifically, the 2D alignment of galaxy shapes with large-scale 
         filaments is quantified as a function of Sérsic indices and masses. We find the known trend 
         that more massive galaxies are closer to filament spines. At fixed stellar masses, 
         morphologies correlate both with densities and distances to large-scale filaments. 
         In addition, the large volume of this data set allows us to detect a signal indicating 
         that there is a preferential alignment of the major axis of massive early-type galaxies 
         along projected cosmic filaments. Overall, these results demonstrate our capabilities to 
         carry out detailed studies of galaxy environments with Euclid, which will be extended to 
         higher redshift and lower stellar masses with the future Euclid Deep Survey."},

      abstract = "{The matter distribution around galaxy clusters is distributed over several filaments, 
      reflecting their positions as nodes in the large-scale cosmic web. The number of filaments 
      connected to a cluster, namely its connectivity, is expected to affect the physical properties 
      of clusters. Using the first Euclid galaxy catalogue from the Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1),
       we investigate the connectivity of galaxy clusters and how it correlates with their physical 
       and galaxy member properties. Around 220 clusters located within the three fields of Q1 
       (covering ∼63 deg2), are analysed in the redshift range 0.2<z<0.7. 
       Due to the photometric redshift uncertainty, we reconstruct the cosmic web skeleton, 
       and measure cluster connectivity, in 2-D projected slices with a thickness of 
       170 comoving h−1.Mpc and centred on each cluster redshift, by using two different filament 
       finder algorithms on the most massive galaxies (M∗ >10^10.3 M⊙). In agreement with previous 
       measurements, we recover the mass-connectivity relation independently of the filament 
       detection algorithm, showing that the most massive clusters are, on average, connected to a 
       larger number of cosmic filaments, consistent with hierarchical structure formation models. 
       Furthermore, we explore possible correlations between connectivities and two cluster 
       properties: the fraction of early-type galaxies and the Sérsic index of galaxy members. 
       Our result suggests that the clusters populated by early-type galaxies exhibit higher 
       connectivity compared to clusters dominated by late-type galaxies. These preliminary 
       investigations highlight our ability to quantify the impact of the cosmic web connectivity 
       on cluster properties with Euclid.}",

        abstract = "{In this paper we describe our search for galaxy protocluster candidates
        at $4.5< z < 10$ and explore the environmental and physical
        properties of their member galaxies identified through JWST
        wide-field surveys within the CEERS, JADES, and PEARLS NEP-TDF
        fields. Combining with HST data, we identify 2948 robust $z>4.5$
        candidates within an area of 185.4 arcmin$^2$. We determine
        nearest neighbour statistics and galaxy environments. We find
        that high-$z$ galaxies in overdense environments exhibit higher
        star formation activity compared to those in underdense regions.
        Galaxies in dense environments have a slightly increased SFR at
        a given mass compared with galaxies in the lower density
        environments. At the high mass end we also find a gradual
        flattening of the $M_{\star}$-SFR slope. We find that galaxies
        in high-density regions often have redder UV slopes than those
        in low-density regions, suggesting more dust extinction, weaker
        Lyman-alpha emission and / or a higher damped Lyman-alpha
        absorption. We also find that the mass-size relation remains
        consistent and statistically similar across all environments.
        Furthermore, we quantitatively assess the probability of a
        galaxy belonging to a protocluster candidate. In total, we
        identified 26 overdensities at $z=5-7$ and estimate their dark
        matter halo masses. We find that all protocluster candidates
        could evolve into clusters with $M_{\rm halo} >
        10^{14}M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$, thereby supporting the theoretical
        and simulation predictions of cluster formation. Notably, this
        marks an early search for protocluster candidates in JWST wide
        field based on photometric data, providing valuable candidates
        to study cosmic structure formation at the early stages.}",

        cluster counts as a function of redshift and mass can constrain
        the parameters of our Universe. They are also useful in order to
        understand the formation and evolution of clusters. We develop
        an improved version of the Adami \& MAzure Cluster FInder
        (AMACFI), now the Adami, MAzure \& Sarron Cluster FInder
        (AMASCFI), and apply it to the 154 deg$^{2}$ of the Canada-
        France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) to obtain a large
        catalogue of 1371 cluster candidates with mass M$_{200}$ >
        {}10$^{14}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and redshift z
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 0.7. We derive the selection function of the
        algorithm from the Millennium simulation, and cluster masses
        from a richness-mass scaling relation built from matching our
        candidates with X-ray detections. We study the evolution of
        these clusters with mass and redshift by computing the i'-band
        galaxy luminosity functions (GLFs) for the early-type (ETGs) and
        late-type galaxies (LTGs). This sample is 90\% pure and 70\%
        complete, and therefore our results are representative of a
        large fraction of the cluster population in these redshift and
        mass ranges. We find an increase in both the ETG and LTG faint
        populations with decreasing redshift (with Schechter slopes
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{ETG}$ = -0.65 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03
        and {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{LTG}$ = -0.95 {\ensuremath{\pm}}

        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02 and {\ensuremath{\alpha}}$_{LTG}$ =
        -1.26 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 at z = 0.2) and also a decrease in
        the LTG (but not the ETG) bright end. Our large sample allows us
        to break the degeneracy between mass and redshift, finding that
        the redshift evolution is more pronounced in high-mass clusters,
        but that there is no significant dependence of the faint end on
        mass for a given redshift. These results show that the cluster
        red sequence is mainly formed at redshift z > 0.7, and that
        faint ETGs continue to enrich the red sequence through quenching
        of brighter LTGs at z {\ensuremath{\leq}} 0.7. The efficiency of
        this quenching is higher in large-mass clusters, while the
        accretion rate of faint LTGs is lower as the more massive
        clusters have already emptied most of their environment at

        along the preferred direction of cosmic filaments. These
        structures have proven difficult to detect because their
        contrast is low, however, and only a few studies have focused on
        cluster infall regions. \textbackslash Aims: We detect cosmic
        filaments around galaxy clusters using photometric redshifts in
        the range 0.15 < z < 0.7. We characterise galaxy populations in
        these structures to study the influence of pre-processing by
        cosmic filaments and galaxy groups on star formation quenching.

        cluster sample. The filaments were reconstructed with the

        spectral energy density fitting algorithm and worked with two
        redshift bins (0.15 < z {\ensuremath{\leq}} 0.4 and 0.4 < z <
        0.7). \textbackslash Results: We showed that the AMASCFI cluster
        connectivity (i.e. the number of filaments that is connected to
        a cluster) increases with cluster mass M$_{200}$. Filament
        galaxies outside R$_{200}$ are found to be closer to clusters at
        low redshift, regardless of the galaxy type. Passive galaxies in
        filaments are closer to clusters than star-forming galaxies in
        the low redshift bin alone. The passive fraction of galaxies
        decreases with increasing clustercentric distance up to d
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5 cMpc. Galaxy groups and clusters that are
        not located at nodes of our reconstruction are mainly found
        inside cosmic filaments. \textbackslash Conclusions: These
        results give clues for pre-processing in cosmic filaments that
        could be due to smaller galaxy groups. This trend could be
        further explored by applying this method to larger photometric
        surveys such as the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program
        (HSC-SPP) or Euclid.}",

        abstract = "{We use a large K-selected sample of 299 961 galaxies from the REFINE
        survey, consisting of a combination of data from three of the
        deepest near-infrared surveys, UKIDSS UDS, COSMOS/UltraVISTA,
        and CFHTLS-D1/VIDEO, that were homogeneously reduced to obtain
        photometric redshifts and stellar masses. We detect 2588
        candidate galaxy groups up to z = 3.15 at S/N > 1.5. We build a
        very pure ($ 90{{\rm \,per\ cent}}$) sample of 448 candidate
        groups up to z = 2.5 and study some of their properties. Cluster
        detection is done using the DElaunay TEssellation ClusTer
        IdentiFication with photo-z (DETECTIFz) algorithm that we
        describe. This new group finder algorithm uses the joint
        probability distribution functions of redshift and stellar-mass
        of galaxies to detect groups as stellar-mass overdensities in
        overlapping redshift slices, where density is traced using Monte
        Carlo realization of the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator.
        We compute the algorithm selection function using mock galaxy
        catalogues taken from cosmological N-body simulation lightcones.
        Based on these simulations, we reach a completeness of $\sim \!
        80{{\,\rm per\ cent}}$ for clusters (M$_{200}$ >
        {}10$^{14}$M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) at a purity of $\sim \!
        90{{\, \rm per\ cent}}$ at z < 2.5. Using our 403 most massive
        candidate groups, we constrain the redshift evolution of the
        group galaxy quenched fraction at 0.12 {\ensuremath{\leq}} z <
        2.32, for galaxies with 10.25 < log
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ < 11 in
        0.5 {\texttimes} R$_{200}$. We find that the quenched fraction
        in group cores is higher than in the field in the full redshift
        range considered, the difference growing with decreasing
        redshift. This indicates either more efficient quenching
        mechanisms in group cores at lower redshift or pre-processing by
        cosmic filaments.}",

        satellite quenching in massive clusters at z
        {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 1 using an MCMC framework, focusing on
        two primary parameters: R$_{quench}$ (the host-centric radius at
        which quenching begins) and {\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{quench}$ (the
        time-scale upon which a satellite quenches after crossing
        R$_{quench}$). Our MCMC analysis shows two local maxima in the
        1D posterior probability distribution of R$_{quench}$ at
        approximately 0.25 and 1.0 R$_{200}$. Analysing four distinct
        solutions in the {\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{quench}$-R$_{quench}$
        parameter space, nearly all of which yield quiescent fractions
        consistent with observational data from the GOGREEN survey, we
        investigate whether these solutions represent distinct quenching
        pathways and find that they can be separated between
        'starvation' and 'core quenching' scenarios. The starvation
        pathway is characterized by quenching time-scales that are
        roughly consistent with the total cold gas (H$_{2}$ + H I)
        depletion time-scale at intermediate z, while core quenching is
        characterized by satellites with relatively high line-of-sight
        velocities that quench on short time-scales
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.25 Gyr) after reaching the
        inner region of the cluster (<0.30 R$_{200}$). Lastly, we break
        the degeneracy between these solutions by comparing the observed
        properties of transition galaxies from the GOGREEN survey. We
        conclude that only the 'starvation' pathway is consistent with
        the projected phase-space distribution and relative abundance of
        transition galaxies at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.
        However, we acknowledge that ram pressure might contribute as a
        secondary quenching mechanism.}",

        title = "{Physical properties of more than one thousand brightest cluster galaxies detected in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey}",
        abstract = "{Context. Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are very massive elliptical
        galaxies found at the centres of clusters. Their study gives
        clues to the formation and evolution of the clusters in which
        they are embedded. \textbackslash Aims: We analyse here in a
        homogeneous way the properties of a sample of more than 1000
        BCGs in the redshift range 0.15 < z < 0.7, based on images from
        the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. \textbackslash
        Methods: Based on a recent catalogue of 1371 clusters, we
        applied our automatic BCG detection algorithm and successfully
        identified 70\% of the BCGs in our sample. We analysed their 2D
        photometric properties with GALFIT. We also compared the
        position angles of the BCG major axes with those of the overall
        cluster to which they belong. \textbackslash Results: We find no
        evolution of the BCG properties with redshift up to z = 0.7, in
        agreement with previous results by Chu et al. (2021, A\&A, 649,
        A42), who analysed a sample an order of magnitude smaller, but
        reaching a redshift z = 1.8. The Kormendy relation for BCGs is
        tight and consistent with that of normal elliptical galaxies and
        BCGs measured by other authors. The position angles of the BCGs
        and of the cluster to which they belong agree within 30 degrees
        for 55\% of the objects with well-defined position angles.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: The study of this very large sample
        of more than 1000 BCGs shows that they were mainly formed before
        z = 0.7 as we find no significant growth for the luminosities
        and sizes of central galaxies. We discuss the importance of the
        intracluster light in the interpretation of these results. We
        highlight the role of image depth in the modelling of the
        luminosity profiles of BCGs, and give evidence of the presence
        of an inner structure which can only be resolved on deep surveys
        with limiting apparent magnitude at 80\% completeness m$_{80}$ >
        26 mag arcsec$^{{\ensuremath{-}}2}$.}",
